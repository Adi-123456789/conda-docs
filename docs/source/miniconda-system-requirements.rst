System requirements
===================

* License: Free use and redistribution under the terms of the `EULA for Miniconda <https://legal.anaconda.com/policies/en?name=offering-specific-terms#miniconda>`_.
* Operating system: Windows 10 or newer, 64-bit macOS 10.13+, or Linux, including Ubuntu, RedHat, CentOS 7+, and others.
* If your operating system is older than what is currently supported, you can find older versions of the Miniconda installers in our `archive <https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/>`_ that might work for you.
* System architecture: Windows- 64-bit x86, 32-bit x86; macOS- 64-bit x86 & Apple M1 (ARM64); Linux- 64-bit x86, 64-bit aarch64 (AWS Graviton2), 64-bit IBM Power8/Power9, s390x (Linux on IBM Z & LinuxONE).
* The ``linux-aarch64`` Miniconda installer requires ``glibc >=2.26`` and thus will **not** work with CentOS 7, Ubuntu 16.04, or Debian 9 ("stretch").
* Minimum 400 MB disk space to download and install.

On Windows, macOS, and Linux, it is best to install Miniconda for the local user,
which does not require administrator permissions and is the most robust type of
installation. However, if you need to, you can install Miniconda system wide,
which does require administrator permissions.
